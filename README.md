# Causal-Analysis-of-Healthcare-Interventions
This project aims to assess the causal impact of healthcare interventions (e.g., a new treatment, a public health campaign, or a policy change) on patient outcomes using Causal Machine Learning (Causal ML). The goal is to estimate the effect of the intervention on health outcomes and ensure that the findings are robust against potential biases.
